<p>Andhra Pradesh (English: /ˌɑːndrə prəˈdɛʃ/,[10] Telugu: [ãːndʱrɐ prɐdeːʃ] (listen) abbr. AP) is a state in the southern coastal region of India.[11] It is the seventh-largest state by area covering an area of 162,975 km2 (62,925 sq mi)[12] and tenth-most-populous state, with 49,386,799 inhabitants.[13][14] It is bordered by Telangana to the north-west, Chhattisgarh to the north, Odisha to the north-east, Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the west and the Bay of Bengal to the east.[15] It has the second longest coastline in India after Gujarat, of about 974 km (605 mi).[16] Andhra State was the first state to be formed on a linguistic basis in India on 1 October 1953.[17] On 1 November 1956, Andhra State was merged with the Telugu-speaking areas (ten districts) of the Hyderabad State to form United Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, these merged areas of Hyderabad State were bifurcated from United Andhra Pradesh to form the new state Telangana. The present form of Andhra is similar to Andhra state, but some mandalas like Bhadrachalam are still included in Telangana. Amaravati serves as the capital of the state with the largest city being Visakhapatnam.[18]

Andhra Pradesh was once a major Buddhist pilgrimage site in the country and a Buddhist learning center which can be seen in many sites in the state in the form of monastery ruins, chaityas, and stupas.[19][20] It is also known for being the land of Koh-i-Noor and other globally known diamonds from Kollur Mine.[21] It is also a major producer of rice known as the "Rice bowl of India".[22] Its official language is Telugu; one of the classical languages of India, the fourth most spoken language in India, and the 13th-most spoken language in the world.[23][24] Andhra Pradesh's second official language is Urdu.[25]

Early inhabitants were known as the Andhras, tracing their history back to the Vedic period, when they were mentioned in the 8th century BCE Rigvedic text Aitareya Brahmana. According to the Aitareya Brahmana, the Andhras left North India from the banks of the Yamuna river and migrated to South India.[26][27] The Assaka Mahajanapada (700–300 BCE) was an ancient kingdom located between the Godavari and Krishna rivers in southeastern India. Accounts that people in the region are descended from the Viswamitra are found in the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas.[28][clarification needed] The region also derives its name from the Satavahanas, who are also known as Andhras, the earliest kings of Andhra Pradesh and India</p>
